README - War Card Game (Q1)
---------------------------

Description:
This is a Java implementation of the classic "War" card game, built with JavaFX for graphical interaction.
Two players compete by flipping the top card of their decks; the higher card wins the round.
In the event of a tie, a "war" occurs: each player adds 3 face-down cards and 1 face-up card to decide the winner.

Instructions to Run:
1. Ensure you are using Java 8.
2. Compile all .java files inside the Q1 folder.
3. Open and run the MainMaman11Q1.java file to start the JavaFX application.
4. The interface allows turn-by-turn play using the "Play Turn" button.
5. Game progress and results are shown in dialog boxes.

File Contents:
- Card.java: Represents a single playing card with face, suit, and numeric value.
- DeckOfCards.java: Creates and shuffles a standard 52-card deck using ArrayList.
- Player.java: Represents a player with their hand of cards and related operations.
- WarGame.java: Console-based version of the game (alternative to GUI).
- GameController.java: Logic for the GUI version of the game (JavaFX controller).
- MainMaman11Q1.java: Launches the JavaFX interface and initializes the game.
- game.fxml: JavaFX layout for the game interface.

Notes:
- No external libraries are used; everything is built with standard Java 8 and JavaFX.
- Before submission, make sure to remove the 'package' declarations from all Java and FXML files.
